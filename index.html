      <h2>0. Introduction: Life Goal—Being a Good Father</h2>
      <p>
        My primary life goal is to be a good father, ensuring my children grow up in a
        nurturing, culturally rich, and stimulating environment. For me, being a good
        father means having ample free time, financial security, and a flexible lifestyle
        that allows me to focus on my family and their development.

        <h3>1.1. Degree in Environmental Biology</h3>
        <p>
          I am finishing my degree in Environmental Biology at the Autonomous
          University of Barcelona (UAB).
        </p>
        <p>
          While I may not initially pursue a career in this field, the qualification could
          provide job opportunities in developed countries like Australia or Northern
          Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          When my children are older and seek more independence (around ages 16–18),
          I might revisit my career in biology, particularly if we have settled in a
          developed country by then.

        <h3>1.2. Online Teaching</h3>
        <p>
          I have experience as an online teacher from my time in Sydney, where I taught
          a particular language.
        </p>
        <p>
          This profession appeals to me because it pays well, offers the flexibility to work
          remotely, and fits well with my goal of maintaining free time for my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows me to adapt to living in different places without compromising my
          income.

      <article>
        <h3>1.3. Investment Plans</h3>
        <p>
          I plan to invest in Indonesia with a colleague. We estimate that within a few
          years, the investment will yield returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          This investment could provide us with a steady income equivalent to at least a
          part-time monthly minimum wage or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of investment returns and earnings from online teaching, even
          if my client base remains modest, would enable us to live comfortably,
          especially in countries with lower living costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living in such countries would allow me to save most of my earnings, building
          up financial security for future plans.

      <!-- 2.1. Value of Cultural, Linguistic, and Religious Diversity -->
      <article>
        <h3>2.1. Value of Cultural, Linguistic, and Religious Diversity</h3>
        <p>
          I place great importance on immersing myself and my family in culturally
          diverse environments. This includes not only languages but also understanding
          different religions, traditions, and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Language is an integral part of culture, and I believe my children should
          experience and learn various languages as they immerse in different cultural
          contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          My own background (likely including my wife's different cultural and religious
          background) will expose our children to multiple perspectives, fostering an
          appreciation for diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if we lived in Senegal, our children would learn Wolof, Serer, and
          French, in addition to Catalan, Spanish, and any languages my wife and I speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          In countries like India, they could potentially speak five languages alongside our
          own foreign languages, gaining exposure to multiple religious backgrounds,
          including my own and my wife's.

        <h3>2.2. Living in Multilingual and Multicultural Countries</h3>
        <p>
          I am particularly drawn to multicultural and multilingual countries. These countries offer opportunities for my family to
          experience a wide range of traditions, practices, and ways of living.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being exposed to different cultural and religious practices enriches our lives,
          helping my children grow up with open minds and an appreciation for global
          diversity.

      <!-- 2.3. Seasonal Living Arrangements -->
      <article>
        <h3>2.3. Seasonal Living Arrangements</h3>
        <p>
          If we reside in a tropical or agriculturally focused country, our schedule would
          align with the seasonal rhythms typical of primary sector economies, which are
          often busier during certain times like planting or harvest seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, some schools operate around these peak times, and we
          could adapt our lifestyle accordingly, ensuring our children benefit from local
          education while engaging in cultural practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would also take advantage of these busy periods to spend a few months
          each year in another location, such as Mexico, Spain, or my wife's home
          country. This arrangement would allow for intensive immersion in family life
          during these months and create a balanced, rich experience for our children.

      <article>
        <h3>3.1. Learning by Offering, Not Imposition</h3>
        <p>
          I strongly believe in fostering learning opportunities by providing resources and
          experiences rather than imposing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if we have musical instruments, sports equipment, tools for trades
          like engineering, a garden, a kitchen, pets, and so on at home, our children will
          have the freedom to explore and develop interests on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they show interest, such as wanting to learn piano because they see me or
          my partner play occasionally, then we support them by enrolling them in
          lessons. This approach ensures that their motivation is genuine.

      <article>
        <h3>3.2. Providing Diverse Stimuli at Home</h3>
        <p>
          Our home would be filled with a variety of stimuli, including musical
          instruments, sports equipment, tools for engineering and trades, a garden, a
          kitchen, pets, etc. This comprehensive environment will provide many
          opportunities for our children to discover their interests and talents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exposing them to different activities, such as gardening, cooking,
          woodworking, and sports, allows them to engage with diverse life skills.

      <!-- 3.3. Balancing Strict Cultural Norms with a Relaxed Home Environment -->
      <article>
        <h3>3.3. Balancing Strict Cultural Norms with a Relaxed Home Environment</h3>
        <p>
          I believe in taking advantage of local cultural norms that may be stricter or
          more disciplined than those I impose at home. In some countries, school
          systems or societies may be strict, valuing discipline and academic
          achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
          By offering a more relaxed atmosphere at home, I create a space where my
          children can unwind, feeling less pressure and more support from me as a
          parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach allows me to be their comfort zone and confidant, someone they
          trust and rely on. It also helps in building a stronger, closer relationship,
          encouraging them to open up about their personal lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this bond, I can better understand their needs and challenges, helping me
          to guide and support them effectively while earning their respect and
          appreciation.

          I envision us living in a spacious house in a rural, inland town. A large space

        <p>
          When our children reach around 13 years of age, we would consider relocating
          to a developed country. This transition would allow them to access better
          educational opportunities and a more advanced schooling system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would carefully research countries that offer strong educational systems and a
          quality of life that align with our family values.

          <strong>Australia:</strong> I am particularly interested in Australia due to its strong economy
          and high-quality educational system. It would provide opportunities for me
          to re-enter the workforce, possibly restarting my biology career when my
          children are more independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Other Options:</strong> Depending on our experiences and preferences, other

        <h3>4.4. Multilingual and Multicultural Education</h3>
        <p>
          As we move between countries, our children will naturally acquire multiple
          languages and gain exposure to various cultural and religious backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, living in the Republic of Congo would mean learning Lingala, Monokutuba, and French,
          while living somewhere might expose them to even more languages and cultural
          contexts. They would also maintain our own family languages, Catalan and
          Spanish, along with any others from my wife's background.
        </p>
        <p>
          This linguistic and cultural diversity ensures they become well-rounded, open-
          minded individuals capable of navigating different societies and appreciating
          varied traditions.

      <article>
        <h3>5.1. Avoiding Forced Changes</h3>
        <p>
          It's essential not to force life changes or alter personal goals solely for a
          relationship, as doing so could lead to frustration or dissatisfaction later in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one changes their aspirations or expectations for the sake of a partner, it can
          create a future conflict, particularly if those changes aren't in harmony with the
          partner's own goals.

        <h3>5.2. Ensuring Alignment in Life Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Partners must have aligned goals and foundational agreements to build a stable
          and healthy relationship. Initially, the infatuation phase may overshadow
          fundamental differences, making it easy to overlook these crucial aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the initial excitement fades, discrepancies in life goals can resurface,
          potentially leading to the relationship's end. It's vital to discuss and align these
          aspects early on, ensuring both partners are committed to similar objectives.

      <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        My life plan is deeply rooted in being a present and supportive father, achieved
        through financial stability, flexible work, and immersion in culturally and
        linguistically diverse environments. By combining investment income and
        teaching work, I aim to maximize time with my family while saving for the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing a home environment rich in opportunities for learning—through
        music, trades, cooking, and outdoor activities—ensures my children develop in
        a stimulating and supportive space. Additionally, embracing cultural, linguistic,
        and religious diversity enriches our lives and broadens our horizons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the plan balances financial independence, cultural appreciation, and
        personal freedom, creating a fulfilling and stable family life that remains true to
        our shared aspirations and values.
